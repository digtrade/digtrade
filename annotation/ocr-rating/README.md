Notes on OCR Rating
===================

This directory contains the following information:

- the guidelines for the OCR rating (`rating-guidelines.txt`)
- the ratings for two annotators (`ratedDocuments`).  This file contains the document ID (for the Early Canadiana Online document) and two independent ratings by two raters, separated by a tab character.
